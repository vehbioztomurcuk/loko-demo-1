### **User Flow Demonstration**

1. **User clicks Import CV** → AI parses → shows preview (*“We created a persona: Mid-level Insurance Professional, 32 years old, risk-conscious.”*) → Start simulation.
2. **User clicks Go Manual** → chatbot bubble appears:

   * *“Hi! Let’s configure your practice. First: Which scenario do you want to try?”*
   * Choices appear as clickable chips/buttons (*Cold Call*, *Inbound Request*, etc.).
   * Continues step by step until simulation starts.

This way, your demo has **2 clear entry points**:

* Fast-track (AI auto-extracts)
* Guided track (chat-like manual).
